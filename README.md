## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
{'_source':
 {
'redacted': '<PER> called in from 001-<PHONE>x1311. Their account
number is <SSN>'
'status': 'active'
}
```


**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for beginner to intermediate-level data scientists, undergraduate to masters-level students, and early to mid-senior data scientists or analysts looking to expand their knowledge of machine learning by exploring various R libraries. Basic knowledge of linear algebra and data modeling is a must.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).


### Software and Hardware List

To fully benefit from this book, readers should possess a basic understanding of Elasticsearch
operations, fundamental Python programming skills, and a general familiarity with search concepts.
This foundational knowledge will enable readers to more effectively grasp the advanced techniques
and applications discussed throughout the book.

System requirements are mentioned in the following table:

| Software/Hardware                              | Operating System requirements      |
| ------------------------------------           | -----------------------------------|
| Elasticsearch 8.11+                            | Windows, Linus, and  MacOS         |
| Python 3.9+                                    |                                    |
| Jupyter Notebook                               |

Follow the instructions for the latest Anaconda installation. All scripts in this book assume you will
run the code from the command line within an Anaconda Python environment. If you try to use
Jupyter Notebooks, you may get unpredictable results.
